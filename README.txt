The main objective of this project is, instead of declaring results in the traditional way, declaring the results online and providing immediate services to the students by saving their time.

Hardware and Software Specifications
The development of this project deals with the following environment:
•	Hardware requirements
•	Software requirements

Hardware Requirements

The selection of hardware is very important in the existence and proper working of any software. In the selection of hardware, the size and the capacity requirements are also important.
The Web Based Manufacturing System can be efficiently run on Pentium system with at least 1 GB RAM and Hard disk drive having 20 GB. Floppy disk drive of 1.44 MB and 14 inch Samsung color monitor suits the information system operation.(A Printer is required for hard copy output).

•	Pentium processor     	 --------            233 MHZ or above
•	RAM Capacity          	--------             1GB 
•	Hard Disk 		 --------	     	  20GB
•	Floppy disk                  --------          1.44 MB 
•	CD-ROM Drive           --------           32 HZ
•	KEYBOARD               --------          108 Standard


Software Requirements

One of the most difficult tasks is that, the selection of the software, once system requirement is known is determining whether a particular software package fits the requirements.
After initial selection, further security is needed to determine the desirability of particular software compared with other candidates. This section first summarizes the application requirement question and then suggests more detailed comparisons.


•	Operating System                    --------	       Windows 2000/2007/……
•	Browser                                   --------        IE
•	Web/Software 		--------         Visual studio

Conceptual model 
We used spiral model. Because, If any changes has to be there then we can update in this model, that’s why we are going through this model.
